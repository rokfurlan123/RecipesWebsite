You probably have to change the connection string in appsetings.

I also had a problem with one folder missing. If you get the error about some folder missing, 
just make the wwwwroot/Images/ folder by the name ImagesUser

Edit works, but unfortunately not for photo. It doesn't work, cause of some SQL type of varbinary saving.
For future work I will avoid of saving images in a database.
